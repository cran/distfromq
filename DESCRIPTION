Description: Given a set of predictive quantiles from a distribution,
    estimate the distribution and create `d`, `p`, `q`, and `r` functions
    to evaluate its density function, distribution function, and quantile
    function, and generate random samples. On the interior of the provided
    quantiles, an interpolation method such as a monotonic cubic spline is
    used; the tails are approximated by a location-scale family.
